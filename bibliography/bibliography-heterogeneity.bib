  doi = {10.31219/osf.io/gv25c},
  abstract = {One of the main goals of meta-analysis is to test and estimate the heterogeneity of effect size. We examined the effect of publication bias on the Q-test and assessments of heterogeneity, as a function of true heterogeneity, publication bias, true effect size, number of studies, and variation of sample sizes. The expected values of heterogeneity measures H2 and I2 were analytically derived, and the power and the type I error rate of the Q-test were examined in a Monte-Carlo simulation study. Our results show that the effect of publication bias on the Q-test and assessment of heterogeneity is large, complex, and non-linear. Publication bias can both dramatically decrease and increase heterogeneity. Extreme homogeneity can occur even when the population heterogeneity is large. Particularly if the number of studies is large and population effect size is small, publication bias can cause both extreme type I error rates and power of the Q-test close to 0 or 1. We therefore conclude that the Q-test of homogeneity and heterogeneity measures H2 and I2 are generally not valid in assessing and testing heterogeneity when publication bias is present, especially when the true effect size is small and the number of studies is large. We introduce a web application, Q-sense, which can be used to assess the sensitivity of the Q-test to publication bias, and we apply it to two published meta-analysis. Meta-analytic methods should be enhanced in order to be able to deal with publication bias in their assessment and tests of heterogeneity.},

  volume = {1},
  issn = {2515-2459},
  shorttitle = {Many {{Labs}} 2},
  abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {$<$} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {$<$} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen's ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({$<$} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},
